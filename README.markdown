## Installation

to build/run the following libs/jars are needed:

* [derby.jar](http://db.apache.org/derby/derby_downloads.html)
* [jgoodies-common-1.8.0.jar](http://www.jgoodies.com/downloads/libraries/) and [jgoodies-forms-1.8.0.jar](http://www.jgoodies.com/downloads/libraries/)

place them inside a lib folder in the current dir.

then 'ant build' && 'ant run' should do the trick

you can also create a standalone jar with 'ant jar', to run
the jar simple enter 'java -jar [jarfile]'
